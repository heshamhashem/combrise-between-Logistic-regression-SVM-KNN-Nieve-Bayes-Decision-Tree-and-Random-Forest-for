# combrise-between-Logistic-regression-SVM-KNN-Nieve-Bayes-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-for
In this project we will combrise between Logistic regression &amp; SVM &amp; KNN &amp; Nieve Bayes &amp; Decision Tree and Random Forest for models classification (shown below) using scikit-learn . Our training data set contains continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.Â¶ We will go through 5 tasks to implement our project:  Task 1: Import the important library and exploring the dataset.  Task 2: Identifying Missing Data and dealing with them.  Task 3: Split the Data into Dependent and Independent Variables  Task 4: One-Hot Encoding  Task 5: Centering and Scaling  Task 6: Logistic regression model  Tssk 7: Support vector machine classifier model.  Task 8: K nearest neighbore classifier model.  Task 9: Nieve Bayes model.  Task 10: Decision Tree model.  Task 11: Random Forest model.
